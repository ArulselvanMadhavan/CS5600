1. Realloc(void * ptr,size_t newSize)
Buffer size - 32 blocks.
If the newsize is less than the actual block, then the block is divided and the remaining size is added to the free list.

2. Realloc - Scenario-> 
	a) malloc(64)(Actual Size:96) -> realloc(16)(Actual Size:48) This splits the block into two 48 byte blocks. One byte is returned to user. Another byte is added to the free bin.
	b) realloc(64) -> When a request for 64 comes?
